# Dwata
Empower your team to utilize your product's relational data

## Introduction
A completely visual Database browser and dashboard that queries any **relational database** like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Firebird or Sybase. You do not need to know about SQL queries. Dwata reads your database structure (using SQLAlchemy) and gives you a complete visual experience to drill into your own data.

## Who is this for?
Founders, marketing and sales folks or anyone who does not know SQL and want to view the data from a software product which runs on a relational database (RDBMS).

## What databases are surrported
PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Firebird or Sybase
Dwata uses SQLAlchemy, which is a library build with Python. http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/index.html

## What is the stage of development?
Dwata is in **early stage** of development and is built by the folks in Pixlie, a software consulting company focusing in Python/JavaScript/React applicaitons.

## Get started
This is a Python/Tornado backend with a React frontend. If you know about these, then go ahead, clone this repository and get started right away. This a is **very** young software in progress, you have been warned!
Instructions coming soon for folks who are not aware of these technologies.

## Help us!
We want to build the most awesome data viewer/dashboard, completely open source. If you are interested please Star and Watch this Github repository. Thanks a lot!
