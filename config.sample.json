# The *databases* is a mapping of a name and a URL.
# The name is used in the lessql UI to show list of databases.
# The Connection URL syntax is exactly as used for Python SQLAlchemy:
# http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.create_engine

# The URL is dialect[+driver]://user:password@host/dbname[?key=value..],
#  where dialect is a database name such as mysql, oracle, postgresql, etc.,
#  and driver the name of a DBAPI, such as psycopg2, pyodbc, cx_oracle, etc.

# Alternatively, the URL can be an instance of URL.
# http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.engine.url.URL

# NOTE: Rename this file or create new file named *config.json*
# NOTE: Remove the comments till this line
